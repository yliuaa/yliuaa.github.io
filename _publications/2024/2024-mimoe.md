  The inherent complexity of modality interactions—where text and images may complement, contradict, or independently contribute to the veracity of a social media post—presents a significant challenge for effective multimodal fusion in FND. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{M}odality \textbf{I}nteractive \textbf{M}ixture-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{E}xperts for \textbf{F}ake \textbf{N}ews \textbf{D}etection (MIMoE-FND), a novel hierarchical MoE framework designed to enhance multimodal fake news detection by explicitly modeling modality interactions through an interaction gating mechanism. Our approach captures modality interactions by considering both unimodal prediction agreement and semantic alignment.
