  In this paper, we focus on face component fairness, a fairness notion defined by biological face features. We propose \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{N}etwork-informed \textbf{M}eta \textbf{R}eweighting (BNMR), which incorporates a Bayesian Network calibrator to guide an adaptive meta-learning-based sample reweighting process.
