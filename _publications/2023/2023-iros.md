  We explore how novice \textit{first-time} robot users get habituated to robots and how robot motion impacts the \textit{dynamics} of comfort over repeated interactions. To take the first step towards such understanding, we carry out a user study to investigate the connections between robot motion and user comfort and habituation. Our analyses reveal that workspace overlap, in contrast to speed and legibility, has a significant impact on users' perceived comfort and habituation.
